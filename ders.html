<h1>BTS</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>BTS</b> also known as the,
<STRONG>Bangtan boys</STRONG> is a South Korean <a>boy band</a> formed in 2010. The band consists of 
<a>Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, </a>
 and <a>Jungkook</a>, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a <a>hip hop </a>
 group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have
 focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and <a>coming of age</a>, loss, 
 the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography
 and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an <a>alternate
 universe</a> storyline.</p>
 <p>BTS debuted in 2013 under <a>Big Hit Entertainment</a> with the single album
 <i>2 Cool 4 Skool.</i>
 BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, <i>Dark & Wild</i>
 and <i>Wake up</i> respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, <i>Wings</i> (2016), 
 was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music
 market and led the <a>Korean Wave</a> into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a
 <a>Gold certification</a> from the <a>Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) for their single 
 <a>"Mic Drop"</a>,
 as well as the first act from South Korea to top the <i>Billboard</i>200with their studio album
 <i>Love Yourself: Tear</i> (2018). In 2020, BTS became one of the few groups since <a>the Beatles</a>
 (in 1966–1968) to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years, with <i>Love Yourself: Answer</i> 
 (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became 
 the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the <i>Billboard Hot</i>100 and 
 <i>Billboard Global</i>200 with their Grammy-nominated single <a>"Dynamite"</a>. Follow-up releases 
 <a>"Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter",</a> and <a>"Permission to Dance"</a> made them the fastest 
 act to earn four US number-one singles since <a>Justin Timberlake</a> in 2006.</p>
 <p>As of 2023, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history according to the <a>Circle Chart</a>, having
    sold in excess of 40 million albums. Their studio album <i> Map of the Soul: 7</i>  (2020) is <a>the third 
    best-selling album of all time in South Korea</a>, as well as the first in the country to surpass both four and 
   five million registered sales. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to sell out concerts at
 Wembley Stadium and the <a>Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour,</a> 2019), and were named the <a>International
  Federation of the Phonographic Industry</a>"s (IFPI) <a>Global Recording Artist of the Year</a> for both 2020 and 2021.
 The group's <a>accolades</a> include multiple <a>American Music Awards, <i> Billboard</i> Music Awards, 
    Golden Disc Awards</a>, and nominations for five <a>Grammy Awards</a>. Outside of music, they have addressed three 
 sessions of the <a>United Nations General Assembly</a> and partnered with <a>UNICEF</a> in 2017 to establish the <a>Love Myself</a>
 anti-violence campaign. Featured on <i>time</i>'s international cover as <a>"Next Generation Leaders"</a> and dubbed
 the <a>"Princes of Pop"</a>, BTS has also appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet
  (2017–2019) and the <a>100 most influential people in the world</a> (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest 
  recipients of the South Korean<a> Order of Cultural Merit</a> for their contributions in spreading the Korean 
  culture and language. </p>
 <p>On June 14, 2022, the group announced a scheduled pause in group activities to enable the members to
     complete their <a>mandatory South Korean military service</a>, with a reunion planned for 2025. Jin, the 
     oldest member, enlisted on December 13, 2022, followed by J-Hope on April 18, 2023, and Suga on September
      22, 2023.</p>

      <h1>Name</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>BTS stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), which 
        translates literally to 'Bulletproof Boy Scouts'. According to member <a>J-Hope</a>, the name signifies the
         group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like 
         bullets". In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団). In July 2017, BTS  announced that 
         their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new <a>brand identity</a>.This extended 
         the meaning of their name to encompass the idea of growth "from a boy to an adult who opens the doors
         that are facing forward". </p>

         <h1>History</h1>
         <hr>
          <b>2010–2014: Formation and early years</b> <p> BTS was formed in 2010, after Big Hit Entertainment
             CEO <a>Bang Si-hyuk</a> wanted to form a <a>hip hop group</a> around <a>RM</a> (Kim Nam-joon), an underground rapper 
             well known on the music scene in <a>Seoul</a>. At the time, <a>physical album sales</a> were on the decline and
             digital revenues were not yet high enough to compensate.Seeing a need for diversified income
             streams, Bang decided to form an idol group instead, because of the potential for live concert
             performances and passionate support from fans of such groups. Many trainees refused to become 
             part of an idol group, but <a>J-Hope</a>, RM, and <a>Suga</a> remained.Bang chose to vary from the usual,
             highly regimented idol groups and create one where the members would be individuals rather
             than an ensemble and free to express themselves. Auditions were held in 2010 with plans
             to launch the following year.The band members lived together, practicing up to 15 hours
             a day, and first performed before a small crowd of industry insiders in BTS's representation 
             by Big Hit, rather than one of the three agencies that dominated K-pop at the time, allowed the 
             individual members leeway to express their individuality and have input into the music.On June 12,
             2013, BTS released their debut <a>single album <i>2 Cool 4 Skool,</i></a> along with the <a>lead single</a> 
             "No More Dream", neither of which sold particularly well at the time.On June 13, 2013, BTS made 
             their stage debut on <i> M Countdown </i> with the single, "No More Dream".Nevertheless, according
             to Kathy Sprinkel in her book on BTS, that single was "spotlighting young people's anxiety in the
             face of lofty parental expectations, sent shock waves through the K-pop ranks. Here was a musical
             act that wasn't pulling any punches. More specifically, they had a point of view, and they weren'
             afraid to take on topics that are considered taboo in South Korean society and elsewhere.
             "The album reached the top five on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool,
             BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound from the 1990s The album's release was followed by 
             appearances on Korean music shows, which caught the attention of reviewers and viewers.</p> 
             <p>In September 2013, BTS released the second entry in their "school trilogy": the EP
             <a> O!RUL8,2?</a> The album was released alongside the single "N.O."Similarly to 2 Cool 4 Skool, 
             the new release had a theme of students feeling under pressure and needing to sacrifice their dreams 
             and aspirations.According to scholar Kyung Hyun Kim, many of BTS's earlier works such as "N.O."
              and "No More Dreams" were "expressions of rebellion against the establishment that tapped into
               Korean teenagers' frustrations with the country's educational system" and, he stated, helped 
               them build a fan base among young people in North America and Europe. That same month, 
               BTS starred in their own variety show,<a> SBS MTV'</a>sRookie King Channel Bangtan, in which
                members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and <a>MasterChef Korea.</a>  
                At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards in South Korea. </p>
